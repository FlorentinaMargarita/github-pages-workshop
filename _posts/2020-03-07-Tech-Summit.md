Even it took place on the 7th of March, so one day before the actual International Women’s Day, the attendees, organizers and speakers of the San Diego Tech Women’ summit, celebrated it early. 

## Networking

As for me, listening to inspiring panel discussions of established women in the tech was a wonderful way to celebrate the 2020 women’s day one day early. Despite the corona virus, the San Diego Tech Women’s Summit was sold out to the last seat. And even though, we all tried not to shake hands with each other the summit gave me the opportunity not just to learn interesting aspects about the business, but also to make an array of new connections with very interesting people. The resource fair offered the chance to get in touch with a variety of interesting people, nonprofit groups and potential employers, like Intuit, Amazon and Qualcomm. The nonprofit, which I have never heard of before, but will get in touch with, is <a href="https://www.womenofai.org/"> “Women of AI” </a>, founded by the entrepreneur and former Apple employee Erica Lee.
