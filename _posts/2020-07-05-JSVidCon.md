In this blog post I want to share some of my impressions of the first virtual conference I ever attended. The JSVidcon (www. asdfa) on May 7th 2020. 

Due to Corona, Thursday’s game night with my friends is held via Zoom now. During one of those, my friend Rachel, a Software Engineer, told me about an awesome virtual JavaScript called JSVidCon conference, set to take place May 7th. 

I checked it out online and got a ticket for the React track. Since it happened in the GMT time zone and California happens to be in the Pacific time zone, it started at 7AM for us. My friend missed the first talks due to a meeting and I missed a couple of them during the day as well, since it was a Thursday - hence a regular workday – also during the Corona pandemic.

The quality of the talks differed a lot. Some of them were broad paint brushes, concerned more with the management of large-scale apps, others were more like a technical tutorial you would watch on YouTube on how to configure Webpack with Typescript. Some of the talks had almost a philosophical touch to them, like Adam Klein who shared his thoughts on react hooks. 

All in all I am very happy that I can still keep in touch with the newest developments even if no one is allowed to leave the house. Although I found it hard to concentrated at times and totally missed the one on one talks you usually get to enjoy during “real life events” it was a great opportunity to learn about new developments in the industry.
